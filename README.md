# Post-Left Anarchy Reading List 🏴

A repository for both pdf and epub versions of the essays found in the image below. Of course, [The Anarchist Library](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/special/index) already makes these works accessible, but I thought having (most) of them in one place would make learning easier for those wanting to dip their toes into the various post-left flavors.

**Note**: This is only a reading list from the below image, which makes its rounds quite frequently when interested parties ask the question, "What is post-left anarchy?" [Raddle's Wiki](https://raddle.me/wiki) is another great resource.

## Roadmap
- 🟩 ~~Created Page~~
- 🟨 Upload files (3/24 folders)
- 🟥 Edit Readme to have links to each essay on The Anarchist Library
- 🟥 Add more current essays not featured in the above picture
- ❓ Maybe add resources for Stop the Bleed, OPSEC, and OSINT techniques. 
- ❓ Markdown versions of the files, which The Anarchist Library does not contain.
