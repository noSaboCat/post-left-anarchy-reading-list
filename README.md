# Post-Left Anarchy Reading List 🏴

A repository for both pdf and epub versions of the essays found in the image below. Of course, [The Anarchist Library](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/special/index) already makes these works accessible, but I thought having (most) of them in one place would make learning easier for those wanting to dip their toes into the various post-left flavors.

## Roadmap
