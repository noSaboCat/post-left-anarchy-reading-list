# Post-Left Anarchy Reading List üè¥

A repository for both pdf and epub versions of the essays found in the image below. Of course, [The Anarchist Library](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/special/index) already makes these works accessible, but I thought having (most) of them in one place would make learning easier for those wanting to dip their toes into the various post-left flavors.

This repo is meant not only to make links and files easily accessible, but also to serve as a host in the event that hosts go down, etc. Local copies are very cool. 

I also feel strange about linking to some of the more... shall we say... *choice* items on the list. I'm debating on adding them to the list, even despite the disclaimer. I'd rather not get a visit from the state, even if it is a rite of passage. That being said, those that are available on the Anarchist Library will have links. 

**Note**: This is only a reading list from the below image, which makes its rounds quite frequently when interested parties ask the question, "What is post-left anarchy?" [Raddle's Wiki](https://raddle.me/wiki) is another great resource.

## Roadmap

- üü© Edit Readme to have links to each essay on The Anarchist Library (or Archive.com)
- üü• Add more current essays not featured in the above picture
- ‚ùì Maybe add resources for Stop the Bleed, OPSEC, and OSINT techniques. 
- ‚ùì Markdown versions of the files, which The Anarchist Library does not contain.
